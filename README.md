*Chimer* is a framework for earthquake moment magnitude estimation from observed peak ground motions (PGM). It builds on top of `pyrocko.gf` Green's function data bases for forward modelling seismic sources and waveforms.

Key features include:

* Creation of synthetic ground motion databases
* Caluclation of statistical peak acceleration, velocity and displacement
* Forward modelling of PGM

## Example

```python
from chimer.magnitude_store import PeakAmplitudesBase, PeakAmplitudesStore

from pyrocko import gf

KM = 1e3

engine = gf.LocalEngine(use_config=True)

peak_amplitudes = PeakAmplitudesBase(
        gf_store_id=store_id,
        quantity="displacement",
    )

PeakAmplitudesStore.set_engine(engine)
store = PeakAmplitudesStore.from_selector(peak_amplitudes)

await store.compute_site_amplitudes(source_depth=2 * KM, reference_magnitude=1.0)
await store.find_moment_magnitude(
    source_depth=2 * KM,
    distance=10 * KM,
    observed_amplitude=0.0001,
)
```
